Write a Python program to implement a class named BookStore with the following specifications:

The class should contain two instance variables:
Name (Book Name)
Author (Book Author)
The class should contain one class variable:
NoOfBooks (initialize it to 0)
Define a constructor (__init__) that accepts Name and Author and initializes the instance variables.
Inside the constructor, increment the class variable NoOfBooks by 1 whenever a new object is created.
Implement an instance method:

Display() – should display book details in the following format:

<BookName> by <Author>. No of books: <NoOfBooks>

Obj1 = BookStore("Linux System Programming", "Robert Love")

Obj1.Display()
# Linux System Programming by Robert Love. No of books: 1

Obj2 = BookStore("C Programming", "Dennis Ritchie")

Obj2.Display()
# C Programming by Dennis Ritchie. No of books: 2
